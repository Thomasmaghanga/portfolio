    <h2>Projects Done</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Hello world</em> - This was my first project ever as a coder whereby I created a webpage with just a title, a header<br>
        and a paragraph. I only used HTML in this project</li>
        <li><em>My first website</em> - In this project, I learnt to use images and creating links and even went further by styling the webpage a bit<br>
        by adding color elements on the headers. I used HTML and CSS in this project</li>
        <li><em>Cookie Recipe</em> - In this project, I was formatting an already made webpage by correcting indentation and spacing<br>
        errors. I only used HTML in this project.</li>
        <li><em>Delani Studio Site</em> - In this project, I learnt how to fork a project from someone's repository and clone it to a local repo<br>
        in order to make changes or add to it. I only used HTML in this project.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>About Me</h3> 
    <p>I am a 21 year old software development student at Moringa school with an aim of becoming<br>
     a full-stack web developer in the near future. I have recently acquired a Digital Marketing certificate<br>
     from The Africa Digital Media Institute and I am an ongoing student in Political Science and Public Administration<br>
     at The University of Nairobi. I had previously worked as an SEO expert and media buyer at <a href="http://digital4africa.com">Digital 4 Africa</a> ; a<br>
     digital marketing agency in Nairobi and I co-own an EDM event organising company called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elementkenya/">Element Kenya</a>.<br>
     I am a solution driven person and I strongly feel that a programming course would equip me with the necessary skills<br>
     to achieve my goals. I love solving common problems, planning and attending social events and I am really interested<br>
     in fashion and football, perhaps I might even consider them as industries I would love to contribute to as a programmer.</p>
