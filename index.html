    <h2>Projects Done</h2>
      <p><em><a href="https://github.com/Thomasmaghanga/hello-world">Hello world</a></em> - This was my first project ever as a coder whereby I created a webpage with just a title, a header</p>
      <p>and a paragraph. I only used HTML in this project</p>
      <p><em><a href="https://github.com/Thomasmaghanga/myfirstwebsite">My first website</a></em> - In this project, I learnt to use images and creating links and even went further by styling the webpage a bit</p>
      <p>by adding color elements on the headers. I used HTML and CSS in this project</p>
      <p><em><a href="https://github.com/Thomasmaghanga/crecipe">Cookie Recipe</a></em> - In this project, I was formatting an already made webpage by correcting indentation and spacing</p>
      <p>errors. I only used HTML in this project.</p>
      <p><em><a href="https://github.com/Thomasmaghanga/delani_studio_site">Delani Studio Site</a></em> - In this project, I learnt how to fork a project from someone's repository and clone it to a local repo</p>
      <p>in order to make changes or add to it. I only used HTML in this project.</p>
      
    <h3>About Me</h3> 
      <p>I am a 21 year old <strong>software development</strong> student at Moringa school with an aim of becoming</p>
      <p>a full-stack web developer in the near future. I have recently acquired a Digital Marketing certificate</p>
      <p>from The Africa Digital Media Institute and I am an ongoing student in Political Science and Public Administration</p>
      <p>at The University of Nairobi. I had previously worked as an <strong>SEO expert and media buyer</strong> at <a href="http://digital4africa.com">Digital 4 Africa</a> ; a</p>
      <p>digital marketing agency in Nairobi and <strong>I co-own an EDM event organising company</strong> called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elementkenya/">Element Kenya</a>.</p>
      <p>I am a solution driven person and I strongly feel that a programming course would equip me with the necessary skills</p>
      <p>to achieve my goals. <strong>I love solving common problems, planning and attending social events and I am really interested</p>
      <p>in fashion and football</strong>, perhaps I might even consider them as industries I would love to contribute to as a programmer.</p>
